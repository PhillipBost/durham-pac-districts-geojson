Durham PAC Districts
============================
Durham is comprised of five Partners Against Crime (PAC) Districts which mirror Durham's police districts exactly.

Each PAC District acts as major community hubs where neighbors, police, and local politicians can meet and discuss common problems and potential solutions.
